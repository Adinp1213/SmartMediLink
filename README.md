# smart_pill_dispenser 
 
The purpose of this project is to design and develop a mobile smart pill box to help individuals
with autism, the elderly, and people with disabilities keep track of their medicine and manage
their health. This innovative solution will solve the problem of missed or incorrect doses of
medicine, which can have serious consequences for these populations. The design will be
compact, user-friendly and easy to operate, making it accessible to people of all ages and
abilities. The smart pill box will be equipped with advanced features such as RFID tracker,
path detection, and object detection.
The smart pill box will be an essential tool for ensuring the health and well-being of individuals
with autism, the elderly, and people with disabilities. By reducing the risk of missed or incorrect
doses of medicine, this project will make a significant impact on the quality of life for these
populations.
